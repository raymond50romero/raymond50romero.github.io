###### Who am I? 
My full name is **Raymond Anthony Sanchez Romero**. I was born and raised in California. My path to Computer Science is a bit unconventional but I worked in the agriculture business driving tractors for about 10 years before transfering to UCSD. Now I look forward to start my career in the software.
